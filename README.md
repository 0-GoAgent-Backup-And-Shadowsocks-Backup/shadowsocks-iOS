shadowsocks-nodejs
===========

Current version: 0.1

[shadowsocks](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks) is a lightweight tunnel proxy which can help you get through
 firewalls. This is an iPhone/iPad client.

Since iOS don't support background daemons(without jailbreaking), this client integrated a web browser(iOS-OnionBrowser).
In other words, you can't let other apps go through this proxy.

If you've jailbroken your iPhone, you can use [shadowsocks](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks) /
[Go](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go) version of shadowsocks directly on your iPhone.
